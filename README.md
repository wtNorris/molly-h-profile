Molly Hesse's public web dev profile.

This application is designed to give potential employers all information needed when viewing me as a candidate. It samples my previous work, highlighting my first project. You can navigate to my about me or contact sections, and clicking projects brings you to their respective launched applications.

It is for now a simple application with only css styling. Java will be added as it is learned.

Current issues:
○ First project needs to be flex-flow'd so that it scales properly with the page.
○ Casings need to be made consistent

Additions coming:
○ Javascript for added functionality
○ Additional css added for styling - goal being a more professional look.
